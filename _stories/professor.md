# Professor Gandalf

## Or so I like to remember him

I met him in his lair, on the second floor of the computer center. Buried under a mound of research papers, his eyes scanned through me as I hesitantly asked him to be my research mentor. “You ishall not pass!”, he proclaimed and went back to his paper. Two more visits of pleading and a recommendation from a TA led to him finally taking me in. His academic insights were helpful, and they led to significant research and a published paper, but it was his perspective on philosophy that was truly humbling. He prescribed a strict regimen of math and philosophy, tutoring me on subjects common andarcane. My time with him taught me how to be a better human, and to look up to the future without plain cynicism.
