These two formats enable\nus to present reality media from two\nperspectives: from the “inside” as well\nas the “outside”. The purpose of the\ndigital version is not merely to\nillustrate the affordances of the new\nmedia for the reader, but to allow her\nto enact or even to inhabit the media.\nThe printed book provides a perspective\nthat is the opposite of an immersive\nexperience of AR and VR: a critical\nexplanation of these media in the\ncontexts of media history and their\ndesign aesthetics. The printed version\ncan also address the making of the digital\nversion and reflect on the future\npotential of the digital book.
