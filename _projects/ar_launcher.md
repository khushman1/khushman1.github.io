# Universal AR Launcher

## The need for these feeds

AR has made great strides recently, but needs easily accesible ways of consuming AR content. To this end, this project deals with making the AR equivalent of an app launcher. It explores the idea of a standardized AR interface, working with multiple apps and notification feeds. I plan on using the ARML 2.0 standard and various extensions to it to create an AR content feed, akin to RSS. Feeds can be managed through subscriptions, which ideally can be found on the web. The demo preloaded with some feeds, and content can include Geo-data, marker, and markerless AR.

## Interactions

The project deals with feeds, and provides a universal interface for a user to interact in realtime with them. Current interactions include:

## Demo

Created using THREE.JS, I hope that this demo can showcase the interface experiments I am performing with glancable AR, real world spaces and WebXR. I hope to add in more features including room detection and an app drawers.
